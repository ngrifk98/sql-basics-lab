# SQL Basics Lab

Welcome to the SQL Basics Lab! This project aims to practice SQL queries for creating tables, inserting data, and performing various queries using a sample database.

## Overview

In this project, we explore various SQL operations on multiple tables: person, orders, artist, employee, and invoice. Each table has a specific set of queries that involve creating tables, inserting data, and performing data retrieval operations.

## Files

The `sql-basics` folder contains the following SQL files:
- `person.sql`: Includes queries related to the person table.
- `orders.sql`: Contains queries related to the orders table.
- `artist.sql`: Includes queries related to the artist table.
- `employee.sql`: Contains queries related to the employee table.
- `invoice.sql`: Includes queries related to the invoice table.

## Setup

To run the SQL queries and interact with the sample database, follow these steps:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database on your local machine or use an online SQL tool like db-fiddle.com.
2. Use the provided SQL files (person.sql, orders.sql, artist.sql, employee.sql, invoice.sql) to create the tables and insert sample data into the database.

## Queries

The SQL queries in each file cover various tasks, including filtering data, aggregating results, updating records, and deleting records. Feel free to explore the queries and run them on your database to see the results.

Please exercise caution when running UPDATE and DELETE queries, as they can modify or delete data from your database.
